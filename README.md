Brief summary of climate findings:
Based on my findings, I found that the first day each year with greater temeprature than the first annual temperature is over 130 days. I also noticed throughout the years, the temeprature decreases fro -0.18C in 2016 to -8.71C in 2023. There are no number of temperatures that are over 30.0 degrees Celsius in Deadhorse. Also the average temeprature in 2016-2019 is higher than the average teperature from 2020 to 2023. 

Reflection on Your experience with this assignment:
This assignment took many days to complete; however, I learned a lot. From implementing methods to debugging, I learned how to use Java efficiently. I started this project on Saturday and finished it on Tuesday evening. I went to two TA hours and one office hour and collaborated with my peers. This was definitely very difficult for me as there were a lot of tasks to complete and I had multiple errors that I had trouble debugging. However, peer programing with my classmates helped me learn about the process of programming.
